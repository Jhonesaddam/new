<p>Khulna Tigers changed three foreign players in the XI despite winning two consecutive matches. Instead of Faheem Ashraf, Mohammad Nawaz was included in the team instead of Dasoon Shanaka and Shai Hope.They get fighting capital by relying on the big pair of these two. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Khulna scored 160 runs for 6 wickets after losing the toss against Rangpur Riders at the Sylhet International Stadium. Although the beginning was not good for them. In the second over of the innings, captain Enamul Haque Bijay returned for zero runs off Mahadi Hasan.</p>



<p>In the last over of the power play, Mahadi took the wicket of Mahmudul Hasan. Afif Hossain also did not last long. He was the victim of Hasan Mahmud for 4 runs off 6 balls. As in previous matches, Evin Lewis hinted at being formidable. But Hasan dismissed him for 37 runs off 25 balls with 3 fours and 3 sixes.</p>



<p>Then Dasun Shanaka and Mohammad Nawaz tied the fifth wicket. Play slowly in the beginning to reduce the pressure on the team. Both became aggressive in the 16th over. Ripon collected 18 runs in that over done by Mandal. He took 13 runs in the next over. Azmatullah Omarzai scored 15 runs in the 18th over.</p>



<p>However, Hasan broke this pair of 77 runs by bowling Shanaka in the 19th over. Shanaka scored 40 runs off 33 balls with 5 fours and 1 six. But Mohammad Nawaz picked up the fifty. The Pakistani all-rounder was ripped for 55 runs off 34 balls with 5 fours and 3 sixes.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Shakib Al Hasan returned to the field today after seeing an eye doctor. He did not get a wicket after bowling 4 overs but spent only 20 runs.</p>

<p><strong>Bangladesh U-19 team suffered a big blow in losing against India. However, after overcoming that setback, Tiger Youth defeated Ireland by a big margin.</strong><strong>This time, if they beat their last match opponent USA in the group stage, the Super Six stage will be confirmed. &nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Bangladesh lost the toss and batted first in the &#8216;A&#8217; group match in Bloemfontein today. After losing 7 wickets in 50 overs, they set a big target of 292 runs. Young all-rounder Ariful Islam scored a great century with the bat. Ahrar Amin also played an important innings.</p>



<p>However, Bangladesh&#8217;s batting start was not comfortable. They lost the wicket of opener Adil Bin Siddique (13) for the team&#8217;s 29 runs. After that, another opener Ashiqur Rahman Shibli wants to continue the fight Chowdhury Md. About Rizwan. However, Shibli (27) left before their pair grew up.</p>



<p>After Shibli&#8217;s departure, Rizwan and Ariful formed a good pair. That pair is also ahead of the party 100 in the division. Rizwan&#8217;s innings of 35 runs off 40 balls. But after that, Ariful and Ahran did not allow danger. The duo&#8217;s 122-run stand laid the foundation for Bangladesh&#8217;s big collection. Ahrar returns with 44 runs off 49 balls. And Arif played a great innings of 103 runs off 9 fours off 103 balls. Besides, captain Mahfuzur Rahman Rabi played a 17-ball 31-run innings in the lower middle order.</p>
