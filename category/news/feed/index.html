<p>Khulna Tigers changed three foreign players in the XI despite winning two consecutive matches. Instead of Faheem Ashraf, Mohammad Nawaz was included in the team instead of Dasoon Shanaka and Shai Hope.They get fighting capital by relying on the big pair of these two. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Khulna scored 160 runs for 6 wickets after losing the toss against Rangpur Riders at the Sylhet International Stadium. Although the beginning was not good for them. In the second over of the innings, captain Enamul Haque Bijay returned for zero runs off Mahadi Hasan.</p>



<p>In the last over of the power play, Mahadi took the wicket of Mahmudul Hasan. Afif Hossain also did not last long. He was the victim of Hasan Mahmud for 4 runs off 6 balls. As in previous matches, Evin Lewis hinted at being formidable. But Hasan dismissed him for 37 runs off 25 balls with 3 fours and 3 sixes.</p>



<p>Then Dasun Shanaka and Mohammad Nawaz tied the fifth wicket. Play slowly in the beginning to reduce the pressure on the team. Both became aggressive in the 16th over. Ripon collected 18 runs in that over done by Mandal. He took 13 runs in the next over. Azmatullah Omarzai scored 15 runs in the 18th over.</p>



<p>However, Hasan broke this pair of 77 runs by bowling Shanaka in the 19th over. Shanaka scored 40 runs off 33 balls with 5 fours and 1 six. But Mohammad Nawaz picked up the fifty. The Pakistani all-rounder was ripped for 55 runs off 34 balls with 5 fours and 3 sixes.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Shakib Al Hasan returned to the field today after seeing an eye doctor. He did not get a wicket after bowling 4 overs but spent only 20 runs.</p>

<p>The settlement of the title fight was here! It may not be too much of a risk to say that the Bangladesh Premier League title is once again going to Bashundhara Kings. Because after today&#8217;s match, Abahani Limited has been knocked out of the fight.</p>



<p>Kings have never lost to Abahani in Premier League history. The current champions continue that trend. 2-0 win in the most high-voltage match of the season. As a result of this loss, the gap between Abahani and Kings is now 8 points. Kings have secured the top spot with full 15 points in five matches. Abahani is third with 7 points. For them, hoping for a title is now a daydream.</p>



<p>In the 25th minute of the match at the Sheikh Fazlul Haque Moni Stadium in Gopalganj, Kings went ahead thanks to the Brazilian &#8216;trimurti&#8217;. Darielton Gomes heads in from Miguel Ferreira&#8217;s corner. Robson Robinho scored a great goal with the overhead kick.</p>



<p>At the beginning of the match, however, it was Abahani who made the dangerous attack. In the fifth minute, Kings goalkeeper Anisur Rahman Ziko returned Hriday&#8217;s header with great skill. Abahani then tried to create several opportunities. But they have to go to break from behind.</p>



<p>In the second half, both teams continued to attack. But Abahani had to be disappointed again and again. On the other hand, Miguel doubled the gap in 72 minutes. The Brazilian forward made a fool of the goalkeeper after a great connection with Darielton. In the end, Zico kept a clean sheet for Kings by stopping the shot of Cornelius.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Mohammedan Sporting Club lost points in the other match of the day. They drew goalless against Chittagong Abahani. Alfaz Ahmed&#8217;s team is second in the table with 11 points in five matches. On the other hand, Sheikh Jamal Dhanmondi Club beat Bangladesh Police FC by 2-0 with Sajjad Hossain&#8217;s double goal.</p>
