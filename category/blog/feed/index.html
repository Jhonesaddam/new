<p>Jurgen Klopp will leave the post of coach of Liverpool at the end of this season. He attributed this to &#8216;fatigue&#8217;.</p>



<p>The German coach of the club said this in an interview given to the Allreds&#8217; official website today. He said, &#8216;I informed Liverpool about my decision last November. I know many people will be surprised by this news right now. But I can explain it. &#8216;</p>



<p>&#8216;I love everything about the club and the city. I love its supporters. I love this team, staff and everything. But still seeing this decision, you can understand that it has been taken with a lot of thought. I have run out of fighting strength. But now there is no problem. &#8216;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I knew long ago that it (farewell) must be announced at some point. But now I&#8217;m fine. I know, I can&#8217;t do this again and again. After spending so many years together and going through so much; The place of mutual respect that has been created &#8211; the truth should be told. And that&#8217;s the truth. &#8216;</p>



<p>Klopp took over as Liverpool boss in October 2015. His contract was due to expire in 2026. But he is stepping down a year ago. &nbsp;</p>



<p>After 30 years under Klopp, Liverpool won the Premier League title in the 2019-20 season. The English giants won the Champions League under him in the 2018-19 season. Liverpool have tasted every possible major title during his time. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2019, Klopp&#8217;s side beat Tottenham in Madrid to win the sixth European title (Champions League) in the club&#8217;s history. After that, they won the UEFA Super Cup and the Club World Cup. The following year also brought the Premier League title.</p>



<p>Liverpool won the domestic double in the 2021-22 season. However, the Premier League title was narrowly missed. Manchester City were top of the league by a narrow margin on the final day. Liverpool reached the Champions League final of the same season. But they lost to Real Madrid in the final in Paris. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Liverpool spent last season without winning a major title. But this time they are one of the contenders for four titles. On this day, the team entered the final of the Karabo Cup. They are also at the top of the Premier League points table. They are still 5 points ahead of second placed City. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Maybe Klopp will want to paint the end himself in Liverpool. The color he decorated Liverpool&#8217;s home ground Anfield. Klopp became a bigger star than even the team players. As he received genuine love from the club&#8217;s supporters, he also reciprocated well. The frenzy of Liverpool fans around him was palpable.</p>



<p>Klopp has become synonymous with Liverpool in the past few seasons. The traditional club became the best club in the world under his hands. Footballers like Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane, Virgil von Dijk, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Darwin Nunez have become stars by his hand. All in all, Klopp made himself an integral part of the club&#8217;s history in addition to bringing back the club&#8217;s heritage. &nbsp;</p>
