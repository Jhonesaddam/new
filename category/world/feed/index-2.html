<p>Jurgen Klopp will leave the post of coach of Liverpool at the end of this season. He attributed this to &#8216;fatigue&#8217;.</p>



<p>The German coach of the club said this in an interview given to the Allreds&#8217; official website today. He said, &#8216;I informed Liverpool about my decision last November. I know many people will be surprised by this news right now. But I can explain it. &#8216;</p>



<p>&#8216;I love everything about the club and the city. I love its supporters. I love this team, staff and everything. But still seeing this decision, you can understand that it has been taken with a lot of thought. I have run out of fighting strength. But now there is no problem. &#8216;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I knew long ago that it (farewell) must be announced at some point. But now I&#8217;m fine. I know, I can&#8217;t do this again and again. After spending so many years together and going through so much; The place of mutual respect that has been created &#8211; the truth should be told. And that&#8217;s the truth. &#8216;</p>



<p>Klopp took over as Liverpool boss in October 2015. His contract was due to expire in 2026. But he is stepping down a year ago. &nbsp;</p>



<p>After 30 years under Klopp, Liverpool won the Premier League title in the 2019-20 season. The English giants won the Champions League under him in the 2018-19 season. Liverpool have tasted every possible major title during his time. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2019, Klopp&#8217;s side beat Tottenham in Madrid to win the sixth European title (Champions League) in the club&#8217;s history. After that, they won the UEFA Super Cup and the Club World Cup. The following year also brought the Premier League title.</p>



<p>Liverpool won the domestic double in the 2021-22 season. However, the Premier League title was narrowly missed. Manchester City were top of the league by a narrow margin on the final day. Liverpool reached the Champions League final of the same season. But they lost to Real Madrid in the final in Paris. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Liverpool spent last season without winning a major title. But this time they are one of the contenders for four titles. On this day, the team entered the final of the Karabo Cup. They are also at the top of the Premier League points table. They are still 5 points ahead of second placed City. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Maybe Klopp will want to paint the end himself in Liverpool. The color he decorated Liverpool&#8217;s home ground Anfield. Klopp became a bigger star than even the team players. As he received genuine love from the club&#8217;s supporters, he also reciprocated well. The frenzy of Liverpool fans around him was palpable.</p>



<p>Klopp has become synonymous with Liverpool in the past few seasons. The traditional club became the best club in the world under his hands. Footballers like Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane, Virgil von Dijk, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Darwin Nunez have become stars by his hand. All in all, Klopp made himself an integral part of the club&#8217;s history in addition to bringing back the club&#8217;s heritage. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The settlement of the title fight was here! It may not be too much of a risk to say that the Bangladesh Premier League title is once again going to Bashundhara Kings. Because after today&#8217;s match, Abahani Limited has been knocked out of the fight.</p>



<p>Kings have never lost to Abahani in Premier League history. The current champions continue that trend. 2-0 win in the most high-voltage match of the season. As a result of this loss, the gap between Abahani and Kings is now 8 points. Kings have secured the top spot with full 15 points in five matches. Abahani is third with 7 points. For them, hoping for a title is now a daydream.</p>



<p>In the 25th minute of the match at the Sheikh Fazlul Haque Moni Stadium in Gopalganj, Kings went ahead thanks to the Brazilian &#8216;trimurti&#8217;. Darielton Gomes heads in from Miguel Ferreira&#8217;s corner. Robson Robinho scored a great goal with the overhead kick.</p>



<p>At the beginning of the match, however, it was Abahani who made the dangerous attack. In the fifth minute, Kings goalkeeper Anisur Rahman Ziko returned Hriday&#8217;s header with great skill. Abahani then tried to create several opportunities. But they have to go to break from behind.</p>



<p>In the second half, both teams continued to attack. But Abahani had to be disappointed again and again. On the other hand, Miguel doubled the gap in 72 minutes. The Brazilian forward made a fool of the goalkeeper after a great connection with Darielton. In the end, Zico kept a clean sheet for Kings by stopping the shot of Cornelius.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Mohammedan Sporting Club lost points in the other match of the day. They drew goalless against Chittagong Abahani. Alfaz Ahmed&#8217;s team is second in the table with 11 points in five matches. On the other hand, Sheikh Jamal Dhanmondi Club beat Bangladesh Police FC by 2-0 with Sajjad Hossain&#8217;s double goal.</p>
