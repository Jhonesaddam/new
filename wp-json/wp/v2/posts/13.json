Afif Hossain also did not last long. He was the victim of Hasan Mahmud for 4 runs off 6 balls. As in previous matches, Evin Lewis hinted at being formidable.

Play slowly in the beginning to reduce the pressure on the team. Both became aggressive in the 16th over. Ripon collected 18 runs in that over done by Mandal. He took 13 runs in the next over. Azmatullah Omarzai scored 15 runs in the 18th over.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Hasan broke this pair of 77 runs by bowling Shanaka in the 19th over.
