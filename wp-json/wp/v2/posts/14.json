It may not be too much of a risk to say that the Bangladesh Premier League title is once again going to Bashundhara Kings. Because after today&#8217;s match, Abahani Limited has been knocked out of the fight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kings have never lost to Abahani in Premier League history. The current champions continue that trend. 2-0 win in the most high-voltage match of the season. As a result of this loss, the gap between Abahani and Kings is now 8 points. Kings have secured the top spot with full 15 points in five matches. Abahani is third with 7 points. For them, hoping for a title is now a daydream.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the 25th minute of the match at the Sheikh Fazlul Haque Moni Stadium in Gopalganj, Kings went ahead thanks to the Brazilian &#8216;trimurti&#8217;. Darielton Gomes heads in from Miguel Ferreira&#8217;s corner. Robson Robinho scored a great goal with the overhead kick.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the beginning of the match, however, it was Abahani who made the dangerous attack. In the fifth minute, Kings goalkeeper Anisur Rahman Ziko returned Hriday&#8217;s header with great skill. Abahani then tried to create several opportunities. But they have to go to break from behind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the second half, both teams continued to attack. But Abahani had to be disappointed again and again. On the other hand, Miguel doubled the gap in 72 minutes. The Brazilian forward made a fool of the goalkeeper after a great connection with Darielton. In the end, Zico kept a clean sheet for Kings by stopping the shot of Cornelius.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Mohammedan Sporting Club lost points in the other match of the day. They drew goalless against Chittagong Abahani. Alfaz Ahmed&#8217;s team is second in the table with 11 points in five matches. On the other hand, Sheikh Jamal Dhanmondi Club beat Bangladesh Police FC by 2-0 with Sajjad Hossain&#8217;s double goal.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The settlement of the title fight was here!
